## Context:

This project was completed as Turing School of Software and Designâ€™s first solo project for module two. In the FlashCard project it is the first time we have experienced writing tests for ourselves. This project took me about 6 hours.

## Learning Goals:

For the FlashCard projects we were expected to contribute code to a partially constructed object-oriented application. We should be able to follow the spec to make a working application
while also implementing ES6 classes. I also needed to be able to write modular, reusable code that follows SRP and also implementing a robust testing suite using TDD.
<br>
<br>
## Technologies Used:

This application was written 100% in JavaScript and used the Mocha and Chai testing libraries.
